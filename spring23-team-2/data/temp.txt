Did a preliminary Analysis of the Sidewalk_Hazards_1.csv dataset Determined that it woud be usefull in helping answer question 2. When you overlay the meatmap that I made with the map of the boston neighborhoods (https://www.bostonplans.org/getattachment/64c37bd1-21ac-4ec1-9e3b-5fdbcc135823/)you can begin to see the areas that are reciveing more aid when it comes to actually getting issues repaired. With the neighborhood map you will then be able to tell which neighborhoods are not recieving nearly as many repairs. This can later be paired with other datasets to further determine the causes for certain neighborhoods receiving more help than others.
