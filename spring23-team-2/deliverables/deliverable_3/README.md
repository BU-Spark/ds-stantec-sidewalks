**Goal** 

Create Accessibility Scores for sidewalks that can be used to determine areas in need of improvement. Also find best routes for people to walk to the public facilities

**Background**

 The current system requires residents to call to report sidewalk issues/hazards. We are trying to see through the data how the current system is helping the various regions of Boston and where the help may be lacking. Therefore, with the introduction of accessibility scores we will be able to determine the areas that are not receiving proper treatment of their sidewalks.

**Data Analysis**

We have done preliminary analyses on the data and are currently working on doing a more in depth analysis using the newly provided ramp scores, and sidewalk locations. We have plotted the data to a real map and we can have direct visions of them to find our research directions.

**Result**

We have analyzed all of the initial datasets. As for the new ones we have decided to focus more on the ramps data set with its new accessibility score and the sidewalks dataset to determine accessibility scores for entire sidewalks. We aim to make use of all the elements to decide whether a sidewalk is in good conditions. 

**DataSets**: 

Ramps_new.json, Sidewalks.json, Hospitals.csv, Schools.csv and so on

**Maps**: 

We show most of the result we get in map, it can be found in folder data.

**Code**: 

The code which can generate the maps we draw and all the visualization we provide is under folder named deliverables.

**How to run**: 

For all the dependency to run the code to generate all the result we get, you need to get access to the google drive for data like the shape of the sidewalks. Here is the link https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/1LHf63zWmj43Hu5RmjiEoFa04kBcfQkZM
